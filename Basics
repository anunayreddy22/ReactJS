Libraries-> ReactJs, AngularJS, VueJS etc...

1. ReactJs uses Virtual DOM inorder when changes in the elements happen. Virtual DOM is way faster than Real DOM
2. Advantages with React is also when a certain part of an HTML page occur if we dont use React library it reloads whole HTML page but where as React it makes use of Components so
   they just change the component.
3. React is a component based Front end Library.
4. These Components are independent and reusable.

Two type of components
1. Functional 
2. Class-based

Class-Based Components

1. In this firstly we import react and a structure component

Code:
  import React, {Component} from 'react'

Now 2 questions may arise they are from where are we importing this, and why are we importing

Answer for that question is:

1. We need to import this to use the entiretiy of this library.
